    <p>Eleanor Briccetti’s passion for nature photography stems from a love of wildlife, the outdoors, and
        birdwatching. Some of her favorite haunts include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>San Francisco Bay shoreline</li>
        <li>Palo Alto Baylands Preserve</li>
        <li>Sacramento and Klamath National Wildlife Refuges</li>
        <li>The Grand Tetons</li>
        <li>The Palouse area of Southeast Washington</li>
        <li>Yellowstone National Park</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The San Francisco Bay Area became home in 1994, following a move from Indianapolis, where Eleanor
        enjoyed a busy career as a professional violinist. She was a member of the orchestras of Kansas
        City, Indianapolis, and St. Louis, was an active chamber music performer, ran a program for young
        violinists and cellists, and taught violin privately. Her interest in photography began as a young
        girl, undoubtedly influenced by her father, an avid amateur photographer.</p>
